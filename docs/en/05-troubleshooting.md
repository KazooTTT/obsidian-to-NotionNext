# Troubleshooting

If the problem persists, you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jxpeng98/obsidian-to-NotionNext/issues) with detailed error information and the steps you took.

You can find the error logs in Obsidian by going to developer tools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`) and checking the console for any error messages related to the NotionNext plugin.
