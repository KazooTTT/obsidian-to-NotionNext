# Syncing Notes

After configuring your Notion database in the plugin settings, you can start syncing your Obsidian notes to Notion.

To sync a note, open the note you want to sync and use the "Share to NotionNext" command from the command palette or the note context menu. This will create a new page in your Notion database with the content of your Obsidian note.

You can also set up automatic syncing for specific notes or folders by configuring the plugin settings. This way, any changes you make to your Obsidian notes will be automatically reflected in Notion.
